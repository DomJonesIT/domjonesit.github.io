        <h3>Who Is Dominique L. Jones?</h3>

<p>This is not your typical GitHub personal site, and I'm not your typical developer.</p>
</br>
<p>After attending college for a year and a half as a Business Marketing major, I realized that wasn't where my heart belonged. I desired something creative; something a little more exciting where I could create, design, and develop programs and websites that users could interact with.</p>
</br>
<p>I decided to take up web development.</p>
</br>
<p>Growing up I was always interested in art and how things were developed. I used to take paper from the printer and draw all my favorite sports team logos. My dad hated it, but it gave me the opportunity to create something from scratch. In web development, I get to biuld something from the ground up; the same thing I was attempting while sketching NBA logos.</p>
</br>
<p>After completing my Associate's in Web Development, I sought out more education. I made the decision to further my understanding of computer science by getting my B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Technology.</p>
</br>
<p>I aspired to be more well rounded and software development peaked my interest. I've always loved basketball, and even played from elementary to high school. I feel like computer programming is similar to a basketball playbook; you have to brainstorm, develop, test, and execute basketball plays just like you would do with a computer program.</p>
</br>
<p>I am a South Carolina native who recently moved to the Atlanta area to pursue a career as an IT professional. With the knowledge I've gained during my undergraduate studies combined with my interests in software, web, and application development, I aim to have webpages, programs, and applications I've developed posted on my GitHub site for the world to see.</p>
